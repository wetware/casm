# Copyright Notice

## Contributor Agreement

Following the lead of other open-source projects, all projects under
the Wetware organization require contributors to jointly assign their
copyright on contributed code.  The [Contributor Agreement](CONTRIBUTOR-AGREEMENT.md) (CA) gives
Louis Thibault and the contributor joint copyright interests in the code;
the contributor retains copyrights while also granting those rights to
Louis Thibault as the open-source project sponsor.

The CA is derived from the [Clojure Contributor Agreement](https://clojure.org/dev/contributor_agreement).
By executing the CA, contributors protect the CASM code base, enabling alternative licensing models,
and protect the flexibility to adapt the project to the changing demands of the community.  Please review
the CA for a complete understanding of its terms and conditions.  By contributing source code or other material
to any repository under the Wetware organization, you represent that you have a CA with Louis Thibault for such contributions.
In order to track contributors, you understand that your full name and username may be posted on a web page listing
authorized contributors that is accessible via a public URL.

### Instructions for submitting the agreement

- Submit a PR adding your name to the [CONTRIBUTORS.md] file.
